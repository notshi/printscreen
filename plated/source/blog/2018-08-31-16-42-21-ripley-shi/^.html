Setting up some information for our upcoming workshop tour accompanying the third Outlands 2018 installation. We'll be looking at a basic introduction into shader languages and how you can use this to explore and enhance your current practise as a musician and/or artist. The tour will take place around the UK over two weeks - join us? :}
