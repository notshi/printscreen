This came as a bit of surprise - the music duo we made up for fun now has a few performances coming up. How did that happen? Updating the design of a bandcamp page kinda reminds me of the days when we used to do that for Livejournal and MySpace - maybe the former got a bit coomplicated with the options but it was still much appreciated considering today's walled gardens.
