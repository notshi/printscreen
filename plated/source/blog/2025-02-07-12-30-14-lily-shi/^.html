No templating yet for Inkscape multipage support :)  Putting things together for a workshop i'm doing at the Theatre in the Mill. 
This is for the Untitled 2 artist development programme that they've recently been doing - a really great initiative for artists in Bradford that is sorely needed. 
Probably the first time sharing my own art practise in detail (kinda) but i'm mostly excited about the collaborative chaos during the second half of it.
