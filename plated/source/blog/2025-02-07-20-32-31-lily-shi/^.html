Went through a few (many) different versions of the QOH logo and settling on these ones - mostly trying to find a good balance via the variations of flag (dis)placements. 
Wasn't sure about the typeface but after many months of looking at it, i think it works and the sans typeface complements it legibly.
The circular patch style seems most agreeable with the bandmates - future applications! - other shapes, not so much.
