Flexing old graphic design skills for a concert flyer I'm performing in. Took quite a while for the ol' noggin to get going but when it did, it wouldn't let me stop. Having literally forced myself to stop, there are now just 25 iterations to choose from (all of which I'm not really satisfied with - no surprises there!) - should prolly whittle it down to 5 or something :}
