Went through considerable lengths to source the actual sounds of the instruments we *play* in the game. Finally found a reputable source from the depths of [The Early Music Shop](http://www.earlymusicshop.com); going through countless samples, finding the *right* ones and trimming the chosen ones to a single note. I was going to go one further and make it play a certain tune, depending on which characters you mouse over but felt that might be a tad overkill. Is it though?
